# FCC-Wiki-Scripts
A script to automate git commands related to the FCC Wiki

Work in progress.
The current idea is to have the scripts take arguments so teh user can specify `commit messages`, `path` for the repo and anything else that might be needed so the script works with multiple repositories.
